FSCH's "Master Editor"
======================
Sort of inspired by Nintendos (old?) internal software for final ROM validation and submissions. Afaik it didn't really allow you to edit ROMs, although some additional metadata / post processing 

At the moment just a basic ROM header viewer for Homebrew .nds cartridge dumps or NitroSDK/TwlSDK .srl files. Future plans include adding 3DS ROM file formats, .3ds / .cia / .cci / etc.
